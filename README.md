# PowerBI
Advanced Editor or functions within PowerBI
This is just a repository of code that I have used in my own PowerBI boards that I have created. 
Some of the codes have been edited from others for my refrence when I am working and I have changed or 
created the code on this repository to fit my working needs. 
Everything in here is general so details need to be changed.
